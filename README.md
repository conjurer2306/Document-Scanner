# Document Scanning Application

## Task at hand is to create a document scanning application (like CamScanner) using React Native which allows users to:
1. Click pictures of their documents
2. Crop them and store those cropped images in their local storage.

The application should have the following screens:
1. A screen to scan a new document from the live camera feed, and save that document as an image on the user's local storage. The user must be allowed to edit
the name of the file before saving it.
2. A screen to list all documents created by a user in a grid view. Clicking on a document should open it in the user's gallery application.
3. Bonus: A screen that lets users upload their documents online using FileStack.
This application should run both on Android (version 10 and above) and iOS (version 12 and
above).
